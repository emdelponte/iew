The Epidemiology Commitee of ISPP (International Society of Plant Pathology) is pleased to announce the venue of the 13th International Epidemiology Workshop, in **Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil.** The meeting will be held from April 8th (5PM) to 12th (noon) 2024. Check this website regularly for updates about the meeting.

The **International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW)** is the principal working group of plant disease epidemiology. This is an organization with a rich history, and has met approximately every 5 years since 1963. The regularly published proceedings of the IEW include recognized benchmarks of epidemiology. A significant feature of this conference is that all participants meet as a unified group.

## About the meeting

![First IEW in Pau France, 1963](figs/1963-2.jpg){#Fig1 style="float: right" width="387"}

The **International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW)** is the principal working group of plant disease epidemiology. This is an organization with a rich history, and has met approximately every 5 years since 1963. The regularly published proceedings of the IEW include recognized benchmarks of epidemiology. A significant feature of this conference is that all participants meet as a unified group.

The meeting will take place in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil from 9-12 April 2024 at the [Interludium hotel](https://interludiumhotel.com/).

## About the meeting

The IEW is the principal working group of plant disease epidemiology. This is an organization with a rich history, and has met approximately every 5 years since 1963. The regularly published proceedings of the IEW include recognized benchmarks of epidemiology. A significant feature of this conference is that all participants meet as a unified group.

## Email list

Together with the Epidemiology committee of the International Society of Plant Pathology (ISPP), we are creating an updated **list of emails** that should be more easily maintained and shared with those who would like to share events and other activities in Global Plant Disease Epidemiology. As such, we made a signup email form in google docs. Only two items are required: name and email. You can add an affiliation if you want.

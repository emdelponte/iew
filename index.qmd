## About the meeting

The regularly published proceedings of the IEW include recognized benchmarks of epidemiology. A significant feature of this conference is that all participants meet as a unified group.

## Email list

Together with the Epidemiology committee of the International Society of Plant Pathology (ISPP), we are creating an updated **list of emails** that should be more easily maintained and shared with those who would like to share events and other activities in Global Plant Disease Epidemiology. As such, we made a signup email form in google docs. Only two items are required: name and email. You can add an affiliation if you want.\
